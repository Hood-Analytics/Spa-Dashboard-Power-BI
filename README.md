About

This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to help the owner of a spa better understand the day-to-day workflow, client expenditure, and product profit margin. The dashboard leverages Power BI features such as Dax, writing functions, data modeling, calculated columns, and data visualizations. The dashboard displays the tiles Sales by Transaction Type, Total Sales by Month, Total Sales by Client, and Service Provided by Total Sales.

Executive Summary 

The Business Problem: Spa metrics are currently tracked on a Google scheduling calendar making business analysis difficult at best. The owner of the spa needs a tool to allow for more sophisticated business analysis of service sales, services, and product sales.

The Solution: A Power BI dashboard will provide far greater visibility of every aspect of the business for the owner of the spa. The dashboard will also allow for the compilation of product and service sales, as well as allow for the examination of individual client spend.

Next steps: Although tracking and updating of the dashboard will be a manual process, the visibility these basic functions provide will allow the owner to have far greater visibility of the business and also give periodic feedback for more sophisticated features to be added later.

The Impact: Still early in the process, the dashboard is already providing valuable customer insight. Retail profit margins can be better determined to ensure consistent value above wholesale for spa products. Pricing discrepancies across clients are also being reconciled.

Dashboard Features

Services:
Sales by Transaction Type: This tile allows the owner to see the percentage of payment methods used by customers. Encouraging the use of Zelle or Venmo can minimize transaction costs.

Total Sales by Month: This tile displaying the total sales per month. Once a full year of data has been accumulated business month to month trends can be better viewed and understood.

Total Sales by Client: This tile allows visibility into the most lucrative spa clients. Better understanding of comparative client expenditure can lead to greater overall spa profits.

Products:
Service Provided by Total Sales: This tile allows visibility into the overall contributions of individual spa services. Although not surprising to find that facials comprise the majority of spa earnings, a comparison of the other categories can give important insights.\
Product Sales by Client: This tile allows visibility into individual spa client purchases. Better understanding of comparative client expenditure on products leads to greater overall spa profits.
Total Product Sales: This tile allows visibility into the overall contributions of spa product sales. A comparison between categories can give important inventory management insights.
